<h2>
  Welcome to Friendly Notes!
</h2>
<p>
  This is an anonymous service that lets you paste 
  and share code / text. These pastes are called <b>notes</b>.
</p>
<p>
  Above you can see three links:
  <ol class="index-list">
    <li>
      Main Page - the page you're currently reading.
    </li>
    <li>
      Add a Note - here you can, well, add a note.
    </li>
    <li>
      Random Note - a random note that has been posted.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  Possibly, there will be a REST API in the future, so that
  you'll be able to add notes without even visiting this site. 
</p>
